# Optical detections in miniJPAS

Galaxy clusters are an essential tool to understand and constrain the cosmological parameters of our Universe. Here, one can find galaxy cluster catalogs produced by PZWav (Werner et al. 2022), AMICO (Bellagamba et al. 2019, Maturi et al. 2023), and VT (Ramella et al. 2001, Lopes et al. 2004) using the Pathfinder data of J-PAS, the miniJPAS (Bonoli et al. 2021b).

Taking advantage of the miniJPAS survey overlapping area with the AEGIS survey (Davis et al. 2007), we also produce a new X-ray cluster catalog based on the PZWasv optical detections. 

Relying on precise photometric information, we provide optical mass tracers for the identified clusters, including richness, optical luminosity, and stellar mass. 


For further details about the galaxy cluster catalog, such as photo-z, SED, and stellar-related quantities, see González Delgado et al. (2021) & Hernán-Caballero et al. (2021).

# Output

Alongside the original information from the cluster catalogs, we provide subproducts that can be derived from the galaxies' probabilities, such as richness, optical luminosity, and total stellar, calculated within the characteristic radius (Rc).

Each cluster catalog has an associated galaxy catalog file ("data_~catalog_name.fits"), presenting the membership probability for each galaxy within Rc and the cluster identification number.
